# compiler
Compiler^2. A compiler made by a compiled language (TypeScript). My other works pertaining to Marist College's CMPT 432 (Design of Compilers) can also be found here.

## Setup
1. Download or fork this repo, and extract if necessary.
2. Open index.html
3. That's it! (wasn't it easy?)

## Additional Setup
This project uses TypeScript, as I already mentioned. So you should definitely install TypeScript if you want to join the fun.
`npm install -g typescript`

This project also uses <a href="https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md" target="_blank">gulp</a> to watch for TypeScript files (see gulpfile.js) and compiles them to JavaScript files. Run `gulp` from the command line/terminal to activate this feature.
